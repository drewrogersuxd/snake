compiled code can be played at:
http://www.drewrogers.com/ideas/snake_game/index.html

code also on github:
https://github.com/drewrogersuxd/snake

drew_rogers_snake.zip contains the source code.
main.js contains source js code.
production code can be built by running:
npm run babel
and is in build/main.bundle.js

can test project locally by running:
npm start

My next steps would be:
design and style the UI better
break up JS into components
randomize the food more
refine collision detection
make difficulty of game a user choice
add scoring based on food eaten / length of snake
