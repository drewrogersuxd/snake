compiled code can be played at:<br/>
http://www.drewrogers.com/ideas/snake_game/index.html<br/>

code also on github:<br/>
https://github.com/drewrogersuxd/snake<br/>

drew_rogers_snake.zip contains the source code.
main.js contains source js code.
production code can be built by running:
npm run babel
and is in build/main.bundle.js

can test project locally by running:<br/>
npm start

My next steps would be:<br/>
design and style the UI better<br/>
break up JS into components<br/>
randomize the food more<br/>
refine collision detection<br/>
make difficulty of game a user choice<br/>
add scoring based on food eaten / length of snake<br/>
